# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching

# Dynamo DB
AWS DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service offered by Amazon Web Services. It provides a fast and flexible NoSQL database that can handle any amount of data and scale up or down based on demand. DynamoDB is designed to deliver high availability, durability, and scalability, making it a popular choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput.

# Key concepts of DynamoDB:
1. Tables: In DynamoDB, data is stored in tables. A table is a collection of items, where each item is a set of key-value pairs.
2. Primary Keys: Each table in DynamoDB must have a primary key, which uniquely identifies each item in the table. The primary key can be either a single attribute (simple primary key) or a combination of two attributes (composite primary key).
3. Throughput: In DynamoDB, throughput is measured in read and write capacity units. Read capacity units represent the number of read requests per second that can be processed, while write capacity units represent the number of write requests per second that can be processed.
4. Auto Scaling: DynamoDB provides an auto-scaling feature that automatically adjusts the provisioned throughput capacity of a table based on the incoming traffic.
5. Global Tables: DynamoDB Global Tables is a multi-region, fully managed database replication solution that enables you to replicate your DynamoDB tables across multiple AWS regions.

# Access Patters in NoSQL DataBases
Access patterns refer to the ways in which data is accessed or retrieved from a database or storage system. Access patterns play a crucial role in determining the performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of a system. By understanding and optimizing access patterns, developers can improve the efficiency and reliability of their applications.Optimizing access patterns can involve a variety of techniques such as indexing, caching, partitioning, and sharding. By carefully analyzing and optimizing access patterns, developers can ensure that their systems are performant, scalable, and cost-effective.

# Common access patterns:
1. Key-Value Access: In this access pattern, data is accessed by a unique key value. This pattern is commonly used in NoSQL databases like AWS DynamoDB and Redis.
2. Query Access: This access pattern involves querying a database based on specific criteria. For example, querying a database to retrieve all records that meet a certain set of conditions.
3. Scan Access: In this access pattern, a database is scanned to retrieve all records that meet a certain set of conditions. This pattern can be resource-intensive and should be used with caution.
4. Aggregation Access: This access pattern involves performing calculations or aggregations on a set of data. For example, calculating the sum or average of a set of values.
5. Range Access: This access pattern involves retrieving a range of values from a database. For example, retrieving all records that fall within a specific date range.

# Pre Computing 
Precomputing the output of an application refers to the process of calculating and storing the results of a computation ahead of time, rather than performing the computation in real-time when a user makes a request. By precomputing the output, an application can improve its speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

1. Improved Performance: Precomputing the output of an application can significantly improve its performance by reducing the time it takes to compute and return results to the user. This is because the precomputed results are readily available and can be retrieved and returned to the user much faster than if the computation had to be performed in real-time.
2. Scalability: Precomputing the output of an application can also improve its scalability. By precomputing results, an application can offload processing power and reduce the number of requests it needs to handle in real-time, which can help it handle more concurrent users and traffic.
3. Cost-Effectiveness: Precomputing the output of an application can also reduce the cost of running the application. By reducing the amount of processing power needed to handle requests, an application can reduce the number of servers it needs to run on, which can help reduce infrastructure and operational costs.

# GSI GLOBAL SECONDARY INDEX vs LSI LOCAL SECONDARY INDEX
AWS DynamoDB, indexes are used to improve the performance of queries on a table. There are two types of indexes available: Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) and Local Secondary Indexes (LSI). , GSIs and LSIs are both powerful tools for optimizing queries in DynamoDB. GSIs provide more flexibility and can be created after the table has been created, but they are more expensive. LSIs are limited to a single partition key but are less expensive and can be created when creating the table.

1. Global Secondary Index (GSI): A GSI is an index that allows querying a DynamoDB table using a non-key attribute. A GSI has its own partition key and sort key, which can be different from the table's primary key. A GSI can be created at any time after the table has been created. When querying a GSI, DynamoDB retrieves the data from the index instead of the table, which can improve query performance.
2. Local Secondary Index (LSI): An LSI is an index that allows querying a DynamoDB table using a non-key attribute, but the partition key is the same as the table's primary key. An LSI can be created when creating the table or later, but it can only be created at the time of table creation if the table has a composite primary key. LSIs are limited to a single partition key, which means that they are only useful for queries that retrieve data for a specific partition key.

# Key differences between GSI and LSI:

1. Partition Key: GSIs have their own partition key, which can be different from the table's primary key. LSIs use the same partition key as the table's primary key.
2. Sort Key: Both GSIs and LSIs have their own sort key, which can be different from the table's primary key.
3. Creation: GSIs can be created at any time after the table has been created. LSIs can only be created when creating the table or later, but only if the table has a composite primary key.
4. Query Flexibility: GSIs provide more flexibility in querying data than LSIs because they have their own partition key. LSIs are limited to a single partition key, which means they can only be used for queries that retrieve data for a specific partition key.
5. Cost: GSIs are more expensive than LSIs because they require additional read and write capacity units, and they have their own partition key.

# How can we make multiple requests to the database with a single query with BATCH-WRITTEN-API
In AWS DynamoDB, it is possible to use a single query to perform multiple database operations such as create, put, delete, and update requests. This is achieved by using the BatchWriteItem API, which allows multiple write operations to be executed in a single call,  by using the BatchWriteItem API in DynamoDB, it is possible to perform multiple create, put, delete, and update requests in a single query, which can improve performance and reduce costs, Using the BatchWriteItem API can help reduce the number of requests made to DynamoDB, which can improve performance and reduce costs. However, it is important to note that this approach may not be suitable for all use cases, particularly those that require complex business logic or atomic transactions.

How the api works:
1. Define the WriteRequests: The BatchWriteItem API takes a list of WriteRequests that specify the operations to be performed on the DynamoDB table. Each WriteRequest can be a PutRequest, DeleteRequest, or UpdateRequest.
2. Group the WriteRequests: The WriteRequests are grouped into batches, where each batch can contain up to 25 items or a maximum of 16 MB of data.
3. Execute the BatchWriteItem API: Once the batches are defined, the BatchWriteItem API is called to execute the write operations in the batches. DynamoDB processes the write operations in parallel, which can improve the performance of the overall operation.

# Implementation DynamoDB In Project

1. add boto3 to requirements.txt file.
2. cd into backend-flask run --> pip install -r requirements.txt
3. run docker-compose up.
4. move all existing bash scripts into a new folder inside the db folder name the folder db and remove the db- from the the files names (exept for db-rds-update-sg-rules).

Person 1: Have you ever watched Babylon 5? It's one of my favorite TV shows!
Person 2: Yes, I have! I love it too. What's your favorite season?
Person 1: I think my favorite season has to be season 3. So many great episodes, like "Severed Dreams" and "War Without End."
Person 2: Yeah, season 3 was amazing! I also loved season 4, especially with the Shadow War heating up and the introduction of the White Star.
Person 1: Agreed, season 4 was really great as well. I was so glad they got to wrap up the storylines with the Shadows and the Vorlons in that season.
Person 2: Definitely. What about your favorite character? Mine is probably Londo Mollari.
Person 1: Londo is great! My favorite character is probably G'Kar. I loved his character development throughout the series.
Person 2: G'Kar was definitely a standout character. I also really liked Delenn's character arc and how she grew throughout the series.
Person 1: Delenn was amazing too, especially with her role in the Minbari Civil War and her relationship with Sheridan. Speaking of which, what did you think of the Sheridan character?
Person 2: I thought Sheridan was a great protagonist. He was a strong leader and had a lot of integrity. And his relationship with Delenn was so well-done.
Person 1: I totally agree! I also really liked the dynamic between Garibaldi and Bester. Those two had some great scenes together.
Person 2: Yes! Their interactions were always so intense and intriguing. And speaking of intense scenes, what did you think of the episode "Intersections in Real Time"?
Person 1: Oh man, that episode was intense. It was so well-done, but I could barely watch it. It was just too much.
Person 2: Yeah, it was definitely hard to watch. But it was also one of the best episodes of the series in my opinion.
Person 1: Absolutely. Babylon 5 had so many great episodes like that. Do you have a favorite standalone episode?
Person 2: Hmm, that's a tough one. I really loved "The Coming of Shadows" in season 2, but "A Voice in the Wilderness" in season 1 was also great. What about you?
Person 1: I think my favorite standalone episode might be "The Long Twilight Struggle" in season 2. It had some great moments with G'Kar and Londo.
Person 2: Yes, "The Long Twilight Struggle" was definitely a standout episode. Babylon 5 really had so many great episodes and moments throughout its run.
Person 1: Definitely. It's a shame it ended after only five seasons, but I'm glad we got the closure we did with the series finale.
Person 2: Yeah, the series finale was really well-done. It tied up a lot of loose ends and left us with a great sense of closure.
Person 1: It really did. Overall, Babylon 5 is just such a great show with fantastic characters, writing, and world-building.
Person 2: Agreed. It's one of my favorite sci-fi shows of all time and I'm always happy to revisit it.
Person 1: Same here. I think one of the things that makes Babylon 5 so special is its emphasis on politics and diplomacy. It's not just a show about space battles and aliens, but about the complex relationships between different species and their political maneuvering.
Person 2: Yes, that's definitely one of the show's strengths. And it's not just about big-picture politics, but also about personal relationships and the choices characters make.
Person 1: Exactly. I love how Babylon 5 explores themes of redemption, forgiveness, and sacrifice. Characters like G'Kar and Londo have such compelling arcs that are driven by their choices and actions.
Person 2: Yes, the character development in Babylon 5 is really top-notch. Even minor characters like Vir and Franklin get their moments to shine and grow over the course of the series.
Person 1: I couldn't agree more. And the way the show handles its themes is so nuanced and thought-provoking. For example, the idea of "the one" and how it's used by different characters in different ways.
Person 2: Yes, that's a really interesting theme to explore. And it's not just a one-dimensional concept, but something that's explored in different contexts and with different characters.
Person 1: And the show also does a great job of balancing humor and drama. There are so many funny moments in the show, but it never detracts from the serious themes and the high stakes.
Person 2: Absolutely. The humor is always organic and never feels forced. And the show isn't afraid to go dark when it needs to, like in "Intersections in Real Time" or the episode "Sleeping in Light."
Person 1: Yeah, those episodes are definitely tough to watch, but they're also some of the most powerful and memorable episodes of the series. And it's not just the writing that's great, but also the acting and the production values.
Person 2: Yes, the acting is fantastic across the board. From Bruce Boxleitner's performance as Sheridan to Peter Jurasik's portrayal of Londo, every actor brings their A-game. And the production design and special effects are really impressive for a TV show from the 90s.
Person 1: Definitely. Babylon 5 was really ahead of its time in terms of its visuals and special effects. And the fact that it was all done on a TV budget makes it even more impressive.
Person 2: Yeah, it's amazing what they were able to accomplish with the limited resources they had. It just goes to show how talented the people behind the show were.
Person 1: Agreed. It's no wonder that Babylon 5 has such a devoted fanbase, even all these years later. It's just such a well-crafted and timeless show.
Person 2: Absolutely. I'm glad we can still appreciate it and talk about it all these years later. It really is a show that stands the test of time.
Person 1: One thing I really appreciate about Babylon 5 is how it handles diversity and representation. It has a really diverse cast of characters from different species and backgrounds, and it doesn't shy away from exploring issues of prejudice and discrimination.
Person 2: Yes, that's a great point. The show was really ahead of its time in terms of its diverse cast and the way it tackled issues of race, gender, and sexuality. And it did so in a way that felt natural and integrated into the story.
Person 1: Definitely. It's great to see a show that's not afraid to tackle these issues head-on and address them in a thoughtful and nuanced way. And it's not just about representation, but also about exploring different cultures and ways of life.
Person 2: Yes, the show does a great job of world-building and creating distinct cultures for each of the species. And it's not just about their physical appearance, but also about their customs, beliefs, and values.
Person 1: Absolutely. It's one of the things that sets Babylon 5 apart from other sci-fi shows. The attention to detail and the thought that went into creating this universe is really impressive.
Person 2: And it's not just the aliens that are well-developed, but also the human characters. The show explores the different factions and political ideologies within EarthGov, as well as the different cultures and traditions on Earth.
Person 1: Yes, that's another great aspect of the show. It's not just about the conflicts between different species, but also about the internal struggles within humanity. And it's all tied together by the overarching plot of the Shadow War and the fate of the galaxy.
Person 2: Definitely. The show does a great job of balancing the episodic stories with the larger arc, so that every episode feels important and contributes to the overall narrative.
Person 1: And the show is also great at building up tension and suspense. The slow burn of the Shadow War and the mystery of the Vorlons and the Shadows kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the series.
Person 2: Yes, the show is really good at building up anticipation and delivering satisfying payoffs. Whether it's the resolution of a character arc or the climax of a season-long plotline, Babylon 5 always delivers.
Person 1: Agreed. It's just such a well-crafted and satisfying show, with so many memorable moments and characters. I'm really glad we got to talk about it today.
Person 2: Me too. It's always great to geek out about Babylon 5 with someone who appreciates it as much as I do!
Person 1: Yeah, it's always fun to discuss our favorite moments and characters from the show. And there are so many great moments to choose from!
Person 2: Definitely. I think one of the most memorable moments for me was the "goodbye" scene between G'Kar and Londo in the episode "Objects at Rest." It was such a poignant and emotional moment, and it really showed how far their characters had come.
Person 1: Yes, that was a really powerful scene. It was great to see these two former enemies come together and find common ground. And it was a great way to wrap up their character arcs.
Person 2: Another memorable moment for me was the speech that Sheridan gives in "Severed Dreams." It's such an iconic moment in the show, and it really encapsulates the themes of the series.
Person 1: Yes, that speech is definitely one of the highlights of the series. It's so well-written and well-delivered, and it really captures the sense of hope and defiance that the show is all about.
Person 2: And speaking of great speeches, what did you think of the "Ivanova is always right" speech from "Moments of Transition"?
Person 1: Oh man, that speech gives me chills every time I watch it. It's such a powerful moment for Ivanova, and it really shows her strength and determination as a leader.
Person 2: Yes, that speech is definitely a standout moment for Ivanova's character. And it's just one example of the great writing and character development in the show.
Person 1: Absolutely. It's a testament to the talent of the writers and actors that they were able to create such rich and complex characters with so much depth and nuance.
Person 2: And it's not just the main characters that are well-developed, but also the supporting characters like Marcus, Zack, and Lyta. They all have their own stories and struggles, and they all contribute to the larger narrative in meaningful ways.
Person 1: Definitely. Babylon 5 is just such a well-rounded and satisfying show in every way. It's no wonder that it's still beloved by fans all these years later.
Person 2: Agreed. It's a show that has stood the test of time, and it will always hold a special place in my heart as one of my favorite TV shows of all time.
Person 1: One of the most interesting ethical dilemmas presented in Babylon 5 is the treatment of the Narn by the Centauri. What do you think about that storyline?
Person 2: Yeah, it's definitely a difficult issue to grapple with. On the one hand, the Centauri were portrayed as the aggressors, and their treatment of the Narn was brutal and unjust. But on the other hand, the show also presented some nuance to the situation, with characters like Londo and Vir struggling with their own complicity in the conflict.
Person 1: Exactly. I think one of the strengths of the show is its willingness to explore complex ethical issues like this. It's not just about good guys versus bad guys, but about the shades of grey in between.
Person 2: Yeah, and it raises interesting questions about power and oppression. The Centauri had more advanced technology and military might than the Narn, which allowed them to dominate and subjugate the Narn people. But at the same time, there were also political and economic factors at play that contributed to the conflict.
Person 1: And it's not just about the actions of the Centauri government, but also about the actions of individual characters. Londo, for example, was initially portrayed as a somewhat sympathetic character, but as the series progressed, we saw how his choices and actions contributed to the suffering of the Narn people.
Person 2: Yes, and that raises interesting questions about personal responsibility and accountability. Can an individual be held responsible for the actions of their government or their society? And if so, to what extent?
Person 1: That's a really good point. And it's also interesting to consider the role of empathy and compassion in situations like this. Characters like G'Kar and Delenn showed compassion towards the Narn people and fought against their oppression, while others like Londo and Cartagia were more indifferent or even sadistic in their treatment of the Narn.
Person 2: Yeah, and that raises the question of whether empathy and compassion are innate traits, or whether they can be cultivated through education and exposure to different cultures and perspectives.
Person 1: Definitely. And it's also worth considering the role of forgiveness and reconciliation. The Narn and Centauri eventually came to a sort of reconciliation in the aftermath of the Shadow War, but it was a difficult and painful process that required a lot of sacrifice and forgiveness on both sides.
Person 2: Yes, and that raises the question of whether forgiveness is always possible or appropriate in situations of oppression and injustice. Can the victims of such oppression ever truly forgive their oppressors, or is that too much to ask?
Person 1: It's a tough question to answer. I think the show presents a hopeful message in the end, with characters like G'Kar and Londo finding a measure of redemption and reconciliation. But it's also clear that the scars of the conflict run deep and that healing takes time and effort.
Person 2: Yeah, that's a good point. Ultimately, I think the show's treatment of the Narn-Centauri conflict raises more questions than it answers, which is a testament to its complexity and nuance. It's a difficult issue to grapple with, but one that's worth exploring and discussing.
Person 1: Let's switch gears a bit and talk about the character of Natasha Alexander. What did you think about her role in the series?
Person 2: I thought Natasha Alexander was a really interesting character. She was a tough and competent security officer, but she also had a vulnerable side and a complicated past.
Person 1: Yeah, I agree. I think she added a lot of depth to the show and was a great foil to characters like Garibaldi and Zack.
Person 2: And I also appreciated the way the show handled her relationship with Garibaldi. It was clear that they had a history and a lot of unresolved tension, but the show never made it too melodramatic or over-the-top.
Person 1: That's a good point. I think the show did a good job of balancing the personal drama with the larger political and sci-fi elements. And it was refreshing to see a female character who was just as tough and competent as the male characters.
Person 2: Definitely. I think Natasha Alexander was a great example of a well-written and well-rounded female character. She wasn't just there to be eye candy or a love interest, but had her own story and agency.
Person 1: However, I did feel like the show could have done more with her character. She was introduced fairly late in the series, and didn't have as much screen time as some of the other characters.
Person 2: That's true. I think the show had a lot of characters to juggle, and sometimes that meant some characters got sidelined or didn't get as much development as they deserved.
Person 1: And I also thought that her storyline with Garibaldi could have been developed a bit more. They had a lot of history and tension between them, but it felt like it was resolved too quickly and neatly.
Person 2: I can see where you're coming from, but I also appreciated the way the show didn't drag out the drama unnecessarily. It was clear that they both had feelings for each other, but they also had to focus on their jobs and the larger conflicts at play.
Person 1: I can see that perspective as well. Overall, I think Natasha Alexander was a great addition to the show and added a lot of value to the series. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of her.
Person 2: Agreed. But at least the show was able to give her a satisfying arc and resolution in the end. And that's a testament to the show's strength as a whole.
Person 1: One thing that really stands out about Babylon 5 is the quality of the special effects. What did you think about the show's use of CGI and other visual effects?
Person 2: I thought the special effects in Babylon 5 were really impressive, especially for a show that aired in the 90s. The use of CGI to create the spaceships and other sci-fi elements was really innovative for its time.
Person 1: Yes, I was really blown away by the level of detail and realism in the effects. The ships looked so sleek and futuristic, and the space battles were really intense and exciting.
Person 2: And I also appreciated the way the show integrated the visual effects with the live-action footage. It never felt like the effects were taking over or overshadowing the characters or the story.
Person 1: Absolutely. The show had a great balance of practical effects and CGI, which helped to ground the sci-fi elements in a more tangible and realistic world.
Person 2: And it's also worth noting the way the show's use of visual effects evolved over the course of the series. The effects in the first season were a bit rough around the edges, but by the end of the series, they had really refined and perfected the look and feel of the show.
Person 1: Yes, I agree. And it's impressive how they were able to accomplish all of this on a TV budget. The fact that the show was able to create such a rich and immersive sci-fi universe with limited resources is a testament to the talent and creativity of the production team.
Person 2: Definitely. And it's one of the reasons why the show has aged so well. Even today, the visual effects still hold up and look impressive, which is a rarity for a show that's almost 30 years old.
Person 1: Agreed. And it's also worth noting the way the show's use of visual effects influenced other sci-fi shows that came after it. Babylon 5 really set the bar for what was possible in terms of sci-fi visuals on TV.
Person 2: Yes, it definitely had a big impact on the genre as a whole. And it's a great example of how innovative and groundbreaking sci-fi can be when it's done right.
Person 1: Another character I wanted to discuss is Zathras. What did you think of his character?
Person 2: Zathras was a really unique and memorable character. He was quirky and eccentric, but also had a lot of heart and sincerity.
Person 1: Yes, I thought he was a great addition to the show. He added some much-needed comic relief, but also had some important moments of character development.
Person 2: And I appreciated the way the show used him as a sort of plot device, with his knowledge of time and space being instrumental in the resolution of some of the show's major storylines.
Person 1: Definitely. It was a great way to integrate a seemingly minor character into the larger narrative. And it was also interesting to see the different versions of Zathras from different points in time.
Person 2: Yeah, that was a clever storytelling device that really added to the sci-fi elements of the show. And it was also a great showcase for actor Tim Choate, who played the character with so much charm and energy.
Person 1: I also thought that Zathras was a great example of the show's commitment to creating memorable and unique characters. Even characters that only appeared in a few episodes, like Zathras or Bester, were given distinct personalities and backstories.
Person 2: Yes, that's a good point. Babylon 5 was really great at creating a diverse and interesting cast of characters, with each one feeling like a fully-realized and distinct individual.
Person 1: And Zathras was just one example of that. He was a small but important part of the show's legacy, and he's still remembered fondly by fans today.
Person 2: Definitely. I think his character is a great example of the show's ability to balance humor and heart, and to create memorable and beloved characters that fans will cherish for years to come.

18. now we need to query the database so the users from the seed sql file in db folder can use the users for the seed file inside the ddb folder.
* create (run bash script)
```
./bin/db/create
```
* schema-load
```
./bin/schema-load
```
* seed
```
./bin/db/seed
```
19. make the file executable.
```
chmod u+x bin/ddb/seed
```
20.  execute the bash script.
```
./bin/ddb/seed
```
21. run bash script to check if tables exist if you are getting an error --> youtube 1:06 time.
22. create a new file inside folder ddb --> scan (this will scan the db for data that was just created with seed file as SDK).
```
