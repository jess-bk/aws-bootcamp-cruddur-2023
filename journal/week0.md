# Billing AWS Console
1. created a budget and billing alarm with AWS Console.
2. created a Group and allocated a user to the group with Admin Access.
3. generated AWS Credentials

# AWS CLI
1. configured and installed AWS in vs code
2. created a budget and billing alarm with AWS CLI.

# GITPOD
1. connected to gitub and vs code

# GITHUB
1. connnected to gitpod, created repo

# VS CODE
created 3 json files
1. alarm-config
2. budget-notifications-subscribers
3. budget-json
these josn file were used to create the an alarm for going over the budget set in AWS by the CLI

# Dev Ops - Solution Architect
1. Business Application Layer, USER-INTERFACE, BUSINESS-LOGIC, DATA-ACCESS, these three need to be micro services and the logic needs to be separate, more resilent if one brakes down, it does not effect the other one, The Traditional Iron Triangle, Scope(feature and functionality), Time(schedule), Cost(budget, resources) and these three will determine the quality of service.

2. Good Architecture, Meets requirements and must achieve, these can be technical or business oriented, 
REQUIRMENTS MUST BE MEASURABLE:
.verifiable
.monitorable
.traceable
.feasible 

WAYS OF BEING MEASURABLE: 
.meets the ISO standard
.99.9% uptime, scaling, no crashing.
.User can do specific tasks, CRUD Operations, manage account.

ADDRESS'S: TYPE RISK, ASSUMPTION AND CONSTRANTS
.Risk can prevent the project from being successful
1. Single point of failure (SPoFs)
2. User Commitment
3. Late Delivery
4. This is all linked to the Tradationl Iron Triangle

ASSUMPTIONS ARE THINGS THAT ARE HELD TO BE TRUE AS A DESIGN PRESPECTIVE
1. Sufficient network bandwidth
2. StakeHolders will be available to make decisions
3. Budget is approved

CONSTRAINTS ARE POLICY OR TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS FOR THE PROJECT
1. Time
2. Budget
3. Vendor Selection

# From RAC(RISK, ASSUMPTIONS, CONTRAINTS) THEN YOU CREATE THE DESIGNS:
1. Conceptual Design --> High Level Design
2. Logical Design --> Zoom in Logical Design
3. Physical Design

Conceptual Design: 
Easy to understand for the client
1. Created by business stakeholders and architects
2. Orginaize and define concepts and rules
2. Lucid Charts, draw io, aka --> Napkin Design 

Logical Design
1. Defines how the system should be implemented
2. Environment without actual names or sizes
3. Example: undeployed CFT

Physical Design
1. Representation of the actual thing that is being built
2. IP Addresses, EC2 instances

# TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) is a widely used framework for developing enterprise architecture. 

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is a popular and widely adopted enterprise architecture framework. It provides a comprehensive approach for designing, planning, implementing, and managing enterprise architecture.

TOGAF is structured around four key components: the Architecture Development Method (ADM), the Enterprise Continuum, the Architecture Content Framework, and the Architecture Capability Framework.

The ADM is a step-by-step process for developing and managing enterprise architecture. It includes nine phases that cover the entire architecture development lifecycle, from defining the scope of the architecture to managing the architecture throughout its lifecycle.

The Enterprise Continuum provides a framework for organizing and classifying architecture artifacts and is divided into four levels: the Architecture Landscape, the Solutions Landscape, the Industry Landscape, and the Enterprise Landscape.

The Architecture Content Framework provides a standard for creating and organizing architecture artifacts, which are divided into four categories: the Business Architecture, the Data Architecture, the Application Architecture, and the Technology Architecture.

The Architecture Capability Framework provides guidance on establishing and maintaining an enterprise architecture function, including defining roles and responsibilities, establishing governance, and ensuring the architecture is aligned with the overall business strategy.

Overall, TOGAF provides a flexible and scalable framework for organizations to develop and manage their enterprise architecture in a structured and organized manner, improving alignment between business strategy and IT

# TOGAF KEY FACTORS
1. Architecture vision: This is a high-level view of what the organization wants to achieve through its architecture. It should be aligned with the organization's goals and objectives.

2. Architecture content framework: This is a set of tools and templates that define the content of the architecture. It includes the models, diagrams, and other artifacts that are used to describe the architecture.

3. Architecture development method: This is a step-by-step process for developing the architecture. It includes the phases of architecture development, the deliverables that are produced at each phase, and the activities that are performed in each phase.

4. Architecture governance: This is the process of ensuring that the architecture is aligned with the organization's goals and objectives, and that it is being developed and maintained in a consistent and effective manner.

5. Architecture capability framework: This is a set of tools and techniques that enable the organization to develop and manage its architecture capability. It includes the roles and responsibilities of the architecture team, the skills and competencies required, and the training and development programs needed.

6. Enterprise architecture maturity assessment: This is a process for evaluating the maturity of the organization's architecture capability. It involves assessing the organization's performance in key areas such as governance, process, methodology, and tools.

7. Architecture metrics and measurement: This is the process of defining and using metrics to measure the effectiveness of the architecture in achieving the organization's goals and objectives.

8. Architecture principles: These are the fundamental rules and guidelines that govern the development and use of the architecture. They should be aligned with the organization's goals and objectives, and should be communicated to all stakeholders.

9. Architecture views and viewpoints: These are the different perspectives on the architecture that are required by different stakeholders. They include the business, data, application, and technology viewpoints, among others.

10. Architecture artifacts: These are the documents and other artifacts that describe the architecture. They include the architecture vision, the architecture content framework, the architecture development method, and the architecture governance framework.

# AWS PROVIDES A TOOL IN CONSOLE THAT ALLOWS TO ACHIEVE THE TOGAF STRATEGIES, THIS ALLOWS TO ASK LIST OF QUESTION TO THE CLIENT OR WITH PEOPLE ON THE TEAM SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND FROM THE 6 PILLARS PERSPECTIVE.

Uses the AWS Well-Architected Framework to review your workloads against current AWS best practises

1. Workload = collection of resources and code that makes up a cloud application
2. Asks the right questions(TOGAF APPROACH) to highlight blindspots
2. Naturally falls into the R/R/A/C buckets
3. Powerful tool in the architects toolbelt
4. Contribution from eveyone

THE 6 PILLARS:
1. Operational Excellence
2. Security
3. Reliability 
4. Performance Efficiency

6. Sustainability

# C4 MODEL FOR VISUALISING SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

The C4 model is a lightweight, visual approach to software architecture. It provides a way to create and communicate software architecture diagrams that are easy to understand and focus on the important aspects of the system. It was created by Simon Brown, and it provides a way to think about software architecture in four levels of detail: Context, Containers, Components, and Code.

1. The first level, Context, is the highest level and focuses on the external factors that affect the system. This includes things like the users, external systems, and regulatory requirements. The goal is to create a simple, high-level diagram that communicates the key concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

2. The second level, Containers, focuses on the high-level software components that make up the system. This could include web servers, application servers, databases, and so on. The goal is to show how these components interact with each other to form the system, and to create a shared understanding of the system's high-level architecture.

3. The third level, Components, provides a more detailed view of the software components that make up the containers. This could include modules, libraries, or other code-level artifacts. The goal is to show how these components fit together within the containers, and to identify any potential issues or dependencies.

3. The fourth level, Code, is the lowest level and focuses on the actual code that implements the system. This could include classes, methods, or other code-level constructs. The goal is to provide a detailed view of how the code works, and to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

The C4 model provides a way to communicate software architecture in a clear, concise way. By focusing on the key concepts at each level, it helps to create a shared understanding of the system, and makes it easier to identify potential issues and areas for improvement. It is particularly useful for agile development teams, who need to be able to quickly communicate and understand the software architecture in order to make rapid, informed decisions.
