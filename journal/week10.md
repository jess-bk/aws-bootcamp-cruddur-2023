# Week 10 â€” CloudFormation Part 1

**AWS CloudFormation** is a service that allows you to manage and automate your infrastructure and applications in AWS. With CloudFormation, you can define templates in either JSON or YAML format that describe the resources you want to create, configure, and manage. These resources can include AWS services like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases, as well as custom resources you create yourself.

**Using CloudFormation**, you can easily and efficiently provision and update your resources in a repeatable and automated manner. You can also track changes to your infrastructure over time, and roll back changes if needed. This makes it an ideal solution for managing complex and large-scale infrastructure and applications.

# Key features of CloudFormation

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: CloudFormation allows you to treat your infrastructure as code, enabling you to version control and manage it just like you would any other codebase. This makes it easy to collaborate with other team members and ensure consistency across your deployments.

* **Templates**: CloudFormation templates are used to describe your infrastructure as code. They are written in JSON or YAML, and define the resources and their configurations that you want to create and manage. Templates can be easily versioned, shared, and reused.

* **Automation**: With CloudFormation, you can automate the deployment and management of your infrastructure and applications. This means you can easily replicate your infrastructure in multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production, ensuring consistency and reducing human error.

* **Rollback**: If a deployment fails or produces unexpected results, CloudFormation makes it easy to roll back to a previous, known-good state. This can be done with a single click, and ensures that your infrastructure is always in a consistent state.

* **Integrations**: CloudFormation integrates with many other AWS services, including CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and AWS Config. This enables you to monitor and audit changes to your infrastructure, and ensure compliance with security and regulatory requirements.

* **Security**: CloudFormation can help you to improve the security of your AWS infrastructure by centralizing the configuration of your resources. This can make it easier to manage and audit your security settings.

* **Consistency**: CloudFormation templates can be used to create a repeatable and consistent deployment process for your AWS resources. This can help to ensure that your infrastructure is always up to date and that it meets your specific needs.

* **Reliability**: CloudFormation templates can be used to create highly reliable AWS infrastructure. This is because CloudFormation templates are idempotent, which means that they can be safely executed multiple times without causing any harm to your AWS resources.

# Cfn-lint and Cfn-guard with AWS CloudFormation Templates
**Cfn-lint** and **Cfn-guard** are two open-source tools that help developers and infrastructure engineers to validate and enforce best practices and standards when deploying AWS CloudFormation templates.

**Cfn-lint** is a command-line tool that checks CloudFormation templates for errors and best practices. It performs a static analysis of the template to identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or other issues that may cause the template to fail during deployment. It can be used to catch issues such as missing required properties, invalid data types, and unsupported resource types. By using Cfn-lint, developers can ensure that their CloudFormation templates are valid before deploying them, saving time and avoiding potential issues during the deployment process.

**Cfn-guard**, on the other hand, is a policy-as-code framework for CloudFormation templates. It allows you to define and enforce rules for your templates, ensuring that they meet the compliance and security requirements of your organization. Cfn-guard works by validating templates against a set of rules defined in a policy file, and it will fail templates that do not comply with the rules. This helps to ensure that your templates are secure and compliant with your organization's policies and best practices.

# Installing Cfn-lint and Cfn-guard in Project
Added configuration to gitpod.yml file to install on launching gitpod.

```
tasks:
  - name: cfn
    before: |
      pip install cfn-lint
      cargo install cfn-guard
```

*you will need to re-deploy gitpod to take effect alternatively install manually by running
```
pip install cfn-lint
cargo install cfn-guard
```

# Cloud Formation Implementation In Project

***CLOUDFORMATION FOR NETWORK LAYER***

**First** create a S3 Bucket <add a name that will store all the cloudformation artifacts> and leave the rest as default.
**Second** create a new folder in bin/cfn/networking and create a new file in the folder template.yaml.

*add the code to the template.yaml file.

The template.yaml file creates a VPC with 3 public and 3 private subnets in 3 availability zones. The public subnets have public IP addresses and can be accessed from the internet, while the private subnets do not have public IP addresses and can only be accessed from within the VPC. The template also creates a route table and routes all traffic from the public subnets to the internet through the internet gateway.
 
***Resources created by the template***:

* VPC: A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud.
* Subnets: A subnet is a smaller range of IP addresses within a VPC.
* Internet gateway: An internet gateway is a network interface that allows traffic to flow between the VPC and the internet.
* Route table: A route table is a collection of routes that determine how traffic is routed within a VPC.
* Public subnets: Public subnets have public IP addresses and can be accessed from the internet.
* Private subnets: Private subnets do not have public IP addresses and can only be accessed from within the VPC.
  
***The template also exports the following values***:

* VpcId: The ID of the VPC.
* VpcCidrBlock: The CIDR block of the VPC.
* SubnetCidrBlocks: A list of the CIDR blocks for the public and private subnets.
* SubnetIds: A list of the IDs for the public and private subnets.
* AvailabilityZones: A list of the availability zones for the public and private subnets.
  
**This template can be used to create a VPC infrastructure that can be used to host a variety of applications.**
