# Week 10 â€” CloudFormation Part 1

**AWS CloudFormation** is a service that allows you to manage and automate your infrastructure and applications in AWS. With CloudFormation, you can define templates in either JSON or YAML format that describe the resources you want to create, configure, and manage. These resources can include AWS services like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases, as well as custom resources you create yourself.

**Using CloudFormation**, you can easily and efficiently provision and update your resources in a repeatable and automated manner. You can also track changes to your infrastructure over time, and roll back changes if needed. This makes it an ideal solution for managing complex and large-scale infrastructure and applications.

# Key features of CloudFormation

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: CloudFormation allows you to treat your infrastructure as code, enabling you to version control and manage it just like you would any other codebase. This makes it easy to collaborate with other team members and ensure consistency across your deployments.

* **Templates**: CloudFormation templates are used to describe your infrastructure as code. They are written in JSON or YAML, and define the resources and their configurations that you want to create and manage. Templates can be easily versioned, shared, and reused.

* **Automation**: With CloudFormation, you can automate the deployment and management of your infrastructure and applications. This means you can easily replicate your infrastructure in multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production, ensuring consistency and reducing human error.

* **Rollback**: If a deployment fails or produces unexpected results, CloudFormation makes it easy to roll back to a previous, known-good state. This can be done with a single click, and ensures that your infrastructure is always in a consistent state.

* **Integrations**: CloudFormation integrates with many other AWS services, including CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and AWS Config. This enables you to monitor and audit changes to your infrastructure, and ensure compliance with security and regulatory requirements.

* **Security**: CloudFormation can help you to improve the security of your AWS infrastructure by centralizing the configuration of your resources. This can make it easier to manage and audit your security settings.

* **Consistency**: CloudFormation templates can be used to create a repeatable and consistent deployment process for your AWS resources. This can help to ensure that your infrastructure is always up to date and that it meets your specific needs.

* **Reliability**: CloudFormation templates can be used to create highly reliable AWS infrastructure. This is because CloudFormation templates are idempotent, which means that they can be safely executed multiple times without causing any harm to your AWS resources.

# Cfn-lint and Cfn-guard with AWS CloudFormation Templates
**Cfn-lint** and **Cfn-guard** are two open-source tools that help developers and infrastructure engineers to validate and enforce best practices and standards when deploying AWS CloudFormation templates.

**Cfn-lint** is a command-line tool that checks CloudFormation templates for errors and best practices. It performs a static analysis of the template to identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or other issues that may cause the template to fail during deployment. It can be used to catch issues such as missing required properties, invalid data types, and unsupported resource types. By using Cfn-lint, developers can ensure that their CloudFormation templates are valid before deploying them, saving time and avoiding potential issues during the deployment process.

**Cfn-guard**, on the other hand, is a policy-as-code framework for CloudFormation templates. It allows you to define and enforce rules for your templates, ensuring that they meet the compliance and security requirements of your organization. Cfn-guard works by validating templates against a set of rules defined in a policy file, and it will fail templates that do not comply with the rules. This helps to ensure that your templates are secure and compliant with your organization's policies and best practices.

# Installing Cfn-lint and Cfn-guard in Project
Added configuration to gitpod.yml file to install on launching gitpod.

```
tasks:
  - name: cfn
    before: |
      pip install cfn-lint
      cargo install cfn-guard
```

*you will need to re-deploy gitpod to take effect alternatively install manually by running
```
pip install cfn-lint
cargo install cfn-guard
```

The template.yaml file creates a VPC with 3 public and 3 private subnets in 3 availability zones. The public subnets have public IP addresses and can be accessed from the internet, while the private subnets do not have public IP addresses and can only be accessed from within the VPC. The template also creates a route table and routes all traffic from the public subnets to the internet through the internet gateway.
 
***Resources created by the template***:

* VPC: A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud.
* Subnets: A subnet is a smaller range of IP addresses within a VPC.
* Internet gateway: An internet gateway is a network interface that allows traffic to flow between the VPC and the internet.
* Route table: A route table is a collection of routes that determine how traffic is routed within a VPC.
* Public subnets: Public subnets have public IP addresses and can be accessed from the internet.
* Private subnets: Private subnets do not have public IP addresses and can only be accessed from within the VPC.
  
***The template also exports the following values***:

* VpcId: The ID of the VPC.
* VpcCidrBlock: The CIDR block of the VPC.
* SubnetCidrBlocks: A list of the CIDR blocks for the public and private subnets.
* SubnetIds: A list of the IDs for the public and private subnets.
* AvailabilityZones: A list of the availability zones for the public and private subnets.
  
**This template can be used to create a VPC infrastructure that can be used to host a variety of applications.**

# CLOUDFORMATION FOR CLUSTER LAYER PART 2
  
**This AWS CloudFormation template is used to create and configure networking and cluster resources to support Fargate containers.**

1. **AWSTemplateFormatVersion:** Specifies the CloudFormation template version.
  
2. **Description:** Provides a description of the template and its purpose.
  
3. **Parameters:** Defines input parameters that can be provided when creating a stack based on this template. These parameters allow customization of various settings, such as networking components, ports, health checks, etc.
  
4. **Resources:** Describes the AWS resources that will be created and configured by the CloudFormation stack. The template defines the following resources:
  
* **FargateCluster:** Creates an ECS Fargate cluster with specified settings, such as capacity providers, cluster name, logging configuration, and more.
  
* **ALB:** Creates an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with specified settings, such as the load balancer name, type (application), IP address type (ipv4), security groups, subnets, and load balancer attributes.
  
* **HTTPSListener:** Creates an HTTPS listener for the ALB, which listens on port 443 and forwards traffic to a target group.

* **HTTPListener:** Creates an HTTP listener for the ALB, which listens on port 80 and redirects traffic to the HTTPS listener.

* **ApiALBListernerRule:** Creates a listener rule for the ALB that matches the host header value and forwards traffic to a backend target group.

* **ALBSG:** Creates a security group for the ALB with inbound rules allowing HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic from any IP address.

* **ServiceSG:** Creates a security group for the Fargate services, with an inbound rule allowing HTTP traffic from the ALB security group.

* **BackendTG:** Creates a target group for the backend services, with specified health check settings, attributes, and VPC configuration.

* **FrontendTG:** Creates a target group for the frontend services, with specified health check settings, attributes, and VPC configuration.
  
5. **Outputs:** Defines the outputs of the CloudFormation stack, which can be used by other stacks or resources. The outputs include the cluster name, service security group ID, ALB security group ID, frontend target group ARN, and backend target group ARN.
  
These resources and configurations are defined in the template to set up networking, load balancing, and routing for Fargate containers, enabling the deployment of a scalable and resilient application infrastructure on AWS.

**Here is the link to the cloudformation template file.** [Link to Template File](https://github.com/jess-bk/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cfn/cluster/template.yaml)

***CONFIG TOML FILE FOR CLUSTER***
  
The TOML file is defining a section called [deploy] with three key-value pairs inside it. TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) is a configuration file format that is often used for specifying settings and parameters in various application.
  
1. bucket = 'jessbk-cfn-artifacts': This line assigns the value 'jessbk-cfn-artifacts' to the key bucket inside the [deploy] section. It indicates the name of the S3 bucket where CloudFormation artifacts (such as templates and related files) will be stored or retrieved from during the deployment process.
  
2. region = 'us-east-1': This line assigns the value 'us-east-1' to the key region inside the [deploy] section. It specifies the AWS region where the CloudFormation stack will be deployed. In this case, the stack will be deployed in the US East (N. Virginia) region.
  
3. stack_name = 'CrdNet': This line assigns the value 'CrdCluster' to the key stack_name inside the [deploy] section. It indicates the desired name for the CloudFormation stack that will be created or updated during the deployment process. In this case, the stack will be named 'CrdCluster'.]
  
4. CertificateArn: Specifies the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of an ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) certificate (arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:517899574827:certificate/e9413679-adc8-4578-a3ae-47f94111bcd8).
  
5. NetworkingStack: Specifies the name of the networking stack (CrdNet) that this CloudFormation stack depends on.
  
**Here is the link to the cloudformation toml file.** [Link to TOML File](https://github.com/jess-bk/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cfn/cluster/config.toml)
  
This TOML file provides configuration settings related to the deployment of a CloudFormation stack, including the S3 bucket name, AWS region, and stack name. These settings can be referenced and used by deployment scripts or tools to deploy the stack with the specified parameters.The CertificateArn and NetworkingStack values may be used as parameters within the CloudFormation template to configure resources or define dependencies on other stacks.

  
**BASH SCRIPT** To run the cloudformation template i have created a bash script, The script performs the following actions:
* set -e: This command sets the script to exit immediately if any command within it fails (returns a non-zero exit status). This is often used to ensure the script stops execution if an error occurs.
  
* CFN_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/cfn/cluster/template.yaml": This line assigns the file path of the CloudFormation template (template.yaml) to the CFN_PATH variable.
  
* CONFIG_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/cfn/cluster/config.toml": This line assigns the file path of the configuration file (config.toml) to the CONFIG_PATH variable.

* echo $CFN_PATH: This line prints the value of the CFN_PATH variable to the console.

* cfn-lint $CFN_PATH: This command runs the cfn-lint tool to check the CloudFormation template file for any potential issues or errors.

* BUCKET=$(cfn-toml key deploy.bucket -t $CONFIG_PATH): This line retrieves the value of the deploy.bucket key from the config.toml file using the cfn-toml tool and assigns it to the BUCKET variable.

* REGION=$(cfn-toml key deploy.region -t $CONFIG_PATH): This line retrieves the value of the deploy.region key from the config.toml file using the cfn-toml tool and assigns it to the REGION variable.

* STACK_NAME=$(cfn-toml key deploy.stack_name -t $CONFIG_PATH): This line retrieves the value of the deploy.stack_name key from the config.toml file using the cfn-toml tool and assigns it to the STACK_NAME variable.
  
* PARAMETERS=$(cfn-toml params v2 -t $CONFIG_PATH): This line retrieves the CloudFormation parameters from the config.toml file using the cfn-toml tool and assigns them to the PARAMETERS variable.

* aws cloudformation deploy ...: This command deploys the CloudFormation stack using the AWS CLI (aws cloudformation deploy). It specifies the stack name, S3 bucket, AWS region, CloudFormation template file, and other deployment options such as tags, prefix, parameter overrides, and capabilities.

**Here is the link to the Cloudformation template file.** [Link to CFN CICD NESTED template](https://github.com/jess-bk/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cicd/nested/codebuild.yaml)
  
**CONFIG TOML FILE FOR CICD** [Link to TOML file](https://github.com/jess-bk/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/cfn/cicd/config.toml)

The provided configuration represent a deployment process using AWS CloudFormation and CodePipeline for a project called "CrdCicd". Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. The deployment is triggered, and the deployment process starts.
2. The CodePipeline process begins by retrieving the source code from the GitHub repository specified in the GithubRepo parameter (jess-bk/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023) using the specified branch (prod).
3. The source code is downloaded and packaged into a ZIP file, which is stored in the S3 bucket specified in the ArtifactBucketName parameter (jessbk-codepipeline-cruddur-artifacts).
4. The CodePipeline then invokes a CodeBuild project to build the container image for the application. The CodeBuild project is defined in the aws/cfn/cicd/nested/codebuild.yaml nested CloudFormation template.
5. The CodeBuild project uses the provided build specification file located at backend-flask/buildspec.yml (assuming the file exists) as specified by the BuildSpec parameter. This build specification file  defines the necessary steps and commands to build the container image.
6. Once the container image is successfully built, it is pushed to an Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository.
7. The final stage in the CodePipeline process is the deployment stage. It deploys the container image to an ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster specified by the ClusterStack parameter (CrdCluster) and the service specified by the ServiceStack parameter (CrdSrvBackendFlask).
8. The deployed service runs the application using the container image from the ECR repository.

In summary, the provided configuration sets up a continuous deployment pipeline using CodePipeline and CodeBuild. It retrieves the source code from GitHub, builds a container image using CodeBuild, and deploys the image to an ECS cluster using CloudFormation stacks (ClusterStack and ServiceStack).

**ExecutionRole:** Type: AWS::IAM::Role
**Properties:** Defines an IAM role for the Lambda function.
**AssumeRolePolicyDocument:** Specifies the trust policy allowing Lambda to assume this role.
**Policies:** Defines the permissions policies associated with the role.

The template sets up a DynamoDB table with a primary key, global secondary index, and DynamoDB Streams enabled. It also provisions a Lambda function that processes the DynamoDB stream. The IAM role and necessary permissions are defined for the Lambda function, along with log group and log stream configurations.

By deploying this CloudFormation template, you can create the specified DynamoDB table, Lambda function, IAM role, and associated resources required for processing the DynamoDB stream.
  
**Here is the link to the template file.** [Link to template yaml file](https://github.com/jess-bk/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/ddb/template.yaml)
  
**LAMBDA FUNCTION** [Link to lambda function](https://github.com/jess-bk/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/ddb/function/lambda_function.py)

This Lambda function is designed to process DynamoDB stream events, specifically targeting events related to message groups. It extracts relevant information from the event, queries the DynamoDB table based on that information, and then re-creates the message group rows with a new sk value.
  
1. **Importing necessary libraries and initializing the DynamoDB resource:**
  * The json and boto3 libraries are imported.
  * The boto3 library is used to create a DynamoDB resource object.
  * The resource object is configured with the region and endpoint URL of the DynamoDB service.
 
2. **lambda_handler function:**
  * This is the entry point for the Lambda function. It is triggered by events from the DynamoDB stream.
  * The function receives the event and context parameters.
  * The function extracts the primary key (pk) and sort key (sk) values from the incoming DynamoDB stream event.
  * If the pk starts with 'MSG#', it indicates a specific message group.
  * The group_uuid is derived from the pk by removing the 'MSG#' prefix.
  * The message value is extracted from the NewImage attribute of the event.
  * The extracted group_uuid and message values are printed.
 
 3. **Querying DynamoDB table based on the group_uuid:**
  * The function defines the table name and index name to perform the query.
  * The DynamoDB table object is created using the configured resource.
  * A query is executed on the table using the query method.
  * The query specifies the index name and the condition to match the message_group_uuid with the extracted group_uuid.
  * The query result (data) is printed.
  
4. **Recreating message group rows with a new sk value:**
  * The function loops over the items (data['Items']) returned from the query.
  * For each item, it performs the following operations:
  * Deletes the existing item from the table using the delete_item method.
  * Prints the result of the deletion operation.
  * Creates a new item in the table using the put_item method.
  * The new item contains the updated sk value and other attributes from the original item.
  * Prints the result of the creation operation.
  
**CONFIG TOML FILE FOR DDB**
  
The [default.build.parameters], [default.package.parameters], and [default.deploy.parameters] sections provide a way to specify region-specific parameters for each stage of the deployment process. By setting the region parameter to "us-east-1" in each section, it ensures consistency and specifies that all stages should be performed in the US East (N. Virginia) region.

The version=0.1 statement at the beginning of the configuration file suggests that this file follows a specific version or format, potentially for compatibility or versioning purposes.

2. **Variable declaration:**
    * The script defines three variables:
    * CYAN='\033[1;36m' and NO_COLOR='\033[0m' are escape sequences used to format the output with colored text.
    * LABEL is set to "DDB BUILD WITH SAM AWS" and will be used for display purposes.

3. **Output formatting:**
  *The script uses printf to display the formatted output with the LABEL variable enclosed in cyan color.

4. **Variable assignment:**
  * FUNC_DIR is set to "/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/ddb/function", specifying the directory where the SAM function code is located.
  * TEMPLATE_PATH is set to "/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/ddb/template.yaml", indicating the path to the SAM template file.
  * CONFIG_PATH is set to "/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/ddb/config.toml", specifying the path to the configuration file used by SAM.

5. **Validation:**
  * The script executes the sam validate command to validate the SAM template.
  * The -t option is used to specify the path to the SAM template file.

6. **Build operation:**
  * The script executes the sam build command to build the SAM application.
  * The specified options and arguments are as follows:**
  * --use-container: This option is used to build the Lambda function inside a container, using the specified runtime.
  * --config-file $CONFIG_PATH: Specifies the configuration file to use for the build operation.
  * --template $TEMPLATE_PATH: Specifies the path to the SAM template file.
  * --base-dir $FUNC_DIR: Specifies the base directory where the function code is located.

  
The script essentially performs a build operation for the SAM application by executing the sam build command. It validates the SAM template using the sam validate command and then builds the application using the specified options and arguments. The output of the script includes formatted output indicating the progress or completion of the build operation.
  
# CLOUDFORMATION FOR MACHINE USER TEMPLATE PART 7 
The CloudFormation template defines two resources: an IAM user (CruddurMachineUser) and an IAM policy (DynamoDBFullAccessPolicy).

1. **CruddurMachineUser:** This resource creates an IAM user named "cruddur_machine_user". IAM users are identities that can be used to interact with AWS services and resources. This user can be used to authenticate and authorize access to various AWS services.

2. **DynamoDBFullAccessPolicy:** This resource creates an IAM policy named "DynamoDBFullAccessPolicy" that grants full access permissions to DynamoDB actions for the specified IAM user (CruddurMachineUser). The policy allows the user to perform actions such as putting items, getting items, scanning, querying, updating items, deleting items, and performing batch writes on any DynamoDB resource (Resource: "*").

This CloudFormation template creates an IAM user named "cruddur_machine_user" and attaches an IAM policy that provides full access to DynamoDB actions. The user can then use the assigned credentials to interact with DynamoDB resources within the AWS environment.

When running the deployment process using these parameter values, it will likely involve creating or updating a CloudFormation stack named 'CrdMachineUser' in the 'us-east-1' region. The artifacts related to this stack will be stored in the 'jessbk-cfn-artifacts' S3 bucket.
  
**Here is the link to the bash script.** [Link to Bash Script](https://github.com/jess-bk/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/bin/cfn/cicd)
  
The script performs linting on the CloudFormation template, extracts necessary configuration values, and deploys the stack using the AWS CLI and CloudFormation, with specific options and parameters.
